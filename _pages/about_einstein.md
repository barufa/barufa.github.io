# About Me

Hi, I’m **Bruno Baruffaldi** 👋  

I’m a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer** and **software developer**, passionate about building systems that actually scale — whether it’s in the cloud ☁️, on the edge 🚜, or somewhere in between. With a background in **Computer Science**, I’ve spent the past years working at the intersection of **deep learning, computer vision, and high-performance software engineering**.

I was the first engineer at [DeepAgro](https://deepagro.com), a startup where I helped design AI systems for **selective herbicide spraying**. My work ranged from **embedded real-time inference** on Nvidia Jetson devices to **cloud-based large-scale model serving**. Along the way, I mentored engineers, researched new ML architectures, and wrote about some of the process.  

This blog — *StuckInLocalMinima* — is where I share things I learn, experiments that didn’t blow up (too badly), and random thoughts on **machine learning projects and code**.

⚡ **Fun facts**  
- I once built a trivia solver that could answer HQTrivia questions in real time with 86% accuracy (before LLMs were mainstream).  
- I enjoy working on parallel algorithms and HPC challenges.  
- The blog name comes from a personal truth: sometimes I’m not stuck in life… just in a local minima.
